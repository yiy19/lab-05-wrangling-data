## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
dn <- dennys
lq <- laquinta
```

### Ex 1. Filter the Denny’s dataframe for Alaska (AK) and save the result as dn_ak. How many Denny’s locations are there in Alaska?

```{r ex1-dn-alaska}
dn_ak <- dn %>%
  filter(state == "AK") # filter for Denny's locations in AK
nrow(dn_ak)             # count the number of observations

```
There are three locations. 


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
